# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before landing changes on the trunk bookmark

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Select Jujutsu revisions:**
```bash
jj status  # snapshot the current working copy before resolving review boundaries
FROM_REVISION=$(jj log --no-graph -r 'first_parent(@)' -T 'commit_id ++ "\n"')
TO_REVISION=$(jj log --no-graph -r '@' -T 'commit_id ++ "\n"')
```

Choose the base revset appropriate to the review: `first_parent(@)` selects one parent even when `@` is a merge commit, `trunk()` selects the trunk revision, and `<bookmark>@<remote>` selects a remote bookmark. Resolve both boundary revsets to their exact commit IDs before dispatch. Never pass workspace-relative revsets such as `@`, `@-`, or `first_parent(@)` as reviewer snapshots; they can resolve differently in another workspace or operation.

**2. Dispatch code reviewer subagent:**

Dispatch a `general-purpose` subagent, filling the template at [code-reviewer.md](code-reviewer.md)

**Placeholders:**
- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary of what you built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{FROM_REVISION}` - Earlier snapshot's exact commit ID
- `{TO_REVISION}` - Later snapshot's exact commit ID

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

FROM_REVISION=$(jj log --no-graph -r 'first_parent(@)' -T 'commit_id ++ "\n"')
TO_REVISION=$(jj log --no-graph -r '@' -T 'commit_id ++ "\n"')

[Dispatch code reviewer subagent]
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/rocketclaw/plans/deployment-plan.md
  FROM_REVISION: [exact commit ID printed above]
  TO_REVISION: [exact commit ID printed above]

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll just review the diff myself instead of dispatching a reviewer" | You're the coordinator — reviewing the diff inline burns the context window you need to keep driving the work. Dispatch a reviewer subagent: the diff and the evaluation live in its context, and only the findings come back to you. |
| "The reviewer needs my whole session history to understand the change" | Hand it precisely crafted context, never your session's history. That keeps the reviewer on the work product, not your thought process. |

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification
