## Subagent dispatch requires multi-agent support

Add to your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

This enables the multi-agent tools that skills like
`dispatching-parallel-agents` and `subagent-driven-development` use.
Which tools you get depends on the multi-agent version your model
preset selects (current presets run V2; older ones run V1). Trust your
actual tool list over any table — including this one — when they
disagree.

- **Spawning:** give children a clean context with
  `spawn_agent {fork_turns: "none"}`; the default `"all"` copies your
  entire transcript into the child. On Codex 0.145+, role files under
  `~/.codex/agents/` attach to isolated forks via `agent_type`.
  Full-history forks accept `model` and `reasoning_effort` overrides
  (only `agent_type` is refused there) — isolated forks are the SDD
  default for context hygiene, not because overrides require them.
- **Fix rounds:** resume the implementer with `followup_task` — it
  delivers your message, triggers a turn, and transparently reloads a
  child the harness evicted. Never dispatch a fresh implementer on the
  theory that a spawned agent cannot be messaged again; on V2 it
  always can.
- **Lifecycle:** V2 has no `close_agent`. Finished children are
  evicted automatically when slots are needed; leaving them unclosed
  costs nothing. Only V1 sessions have `close_agent` — there, close
  reviewers when their review returns, and close each implementer
  after its task's review passes.
- **Model names:** never copy a model name from a skill, table, or old
  session into `spawn_agent` without checking it against your current
  spawn allowlist — V2 accepts only V2-capable presets and hard-errors
  on the rest.

## Waiting on children

`wait_agent` is an event subscription, not a poll: a long wait wakes
the moment a child produces mailbox activity, with the same latency as
a short one. Short-timeout polling buys nothing and costs a tool call —
and a context rebill — per poll. In measured sessions, roughly
two-thirds of all wait calls were short polls that timed out.

- While you still have local work, do not wait at all. A completed
  child's final answer is pushed into your mailbox and arrives with
  your next turn.
- When you are genuinely idle with children outstanding, wait in
  bounded stretches: `wait_agent` with `timeout_ms` 300000-600000
  (5-10 minutes). After each stretch — wake or timeout — post one
  status line, run `list_agents`, and chase any child that finished
  without reporting. Never stack polls shorter than five minutes; the
  event subscription wakes a bounded stretch just as fast as a short
  one.
- Completion mail cannot wake an idle controller (it is delivered
  without triggering a turn); covering that idle window is
  `wait_agent`'s only job. A stretch that times out with no activity
  is your cue to reconcile, not to shorten the next stretch.

## Model routing on spawns

Every `spawn_agent` you issue — including when you are yourself a
spawned child running a fan-out — sets `model` AND `reasoning_effort`
explicitly, per the Model Selection rules of the skill you are
executing. Setting `model` alone is a trap: the child's effort
silently resets to that model's default, not to yours.

Ask your human partner to add a machine-level backstop to
`~/.codex/config.toml` so any spawn that slips through still routes to
a deliberate tier instead of silently inheriting the session's most
expensive model:

```toml
[agents]
default_subagent_model = "<a mid-tier model from your spawn allowlist>"
default_subagent_reasoning_effort = "medium"
```

## Environment Detection

Skills that create workspaces or finish changes should inspect their
environment with read-only Jujutsu commands before proceeding:

```bash
jj root
jj workspace list
jj log -r @ --no-graph
jj bookmark list -r @
```

- A successful `jj root` means the current checkout is already a Jujutsu
  workspace; do not create another workspace around it.
- An unbookmarked `@` is normal in Jujutsu. A bookmark is needed only when the
  change must be published or handed to a Git remote.
- Repository-local commands and the installed `jj help` output take precedence
  over examples here when syntax differs across Jujutsu versions.

Workspace-creation and change-finishing skills should use these signals to
decide whether to create a sibling workspace or publish the current revision.

## Codex App Finishing

When the sandbox blocks bookmark updates or `jj git push`, keep the work in the
current Jujutsu revision, set its description with `jj describe`, report its
change ID, and tell the user to continue from a local Jujutsu workspace.
Repository-local instructions and existing message syntax always win. Based on https://go.dev/wiki/CommitMessage and on past commit messages that you can see in `git log`, compose commit messages adherent to the present standards. Apply compatible Go guidance to clarity and structure, and use `jj describe -m "<message composed from the standards above>"` rather than a fixed message.

From a writable local workspace, create or move a bookmark to the revision,
then publish it with `jj git push --bookmark <bookmark>`. Use the repository's
normal review flow after publishing; do not prescribe a fixed bookmark,
description, or review title.
